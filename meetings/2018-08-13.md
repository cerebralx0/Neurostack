- Data pipelines
    - 3 pipelines: acquisition, post-acq training, production
    - Prod pipeline: Neurostack + WebSockets
    - Training:
        - Acquisition pipeline:
            - General acquisition: do live experiments using BrainTag
                - uses Prod pipeline to save data
                    - AcquisitionService: save data into MNE epochs with tags into a DB
                        - TODO: figure out DB structure
        - Post-acquisition training pipeline:
            - after acquisition, run training alg on DB
- Next Steps:
    - Make trial acquisition pipeline for P300 EEG Notebook
    - Make mock P300 service
